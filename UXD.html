        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>As part of the User Experience Design module, we were tasked with creating a form of interactive media in response to a brief from York Archeology’s Barley Hall attraction. The brief asked we create a more engaging digital training resource for potential volunteers. My concept was a website that showed a virtual rendition of the attraction, in which volunteers could explore a ‘click-through’ style environment, interacting with highlighted objects to gain more information about the hall.

        <h3>Project Details</h3>
        <p>For this exam, I created a Wizard of Oz style prototype using a combination of Adobe suite software to design the prototype and demonstrate the intended interactions that would be present in the final product.
