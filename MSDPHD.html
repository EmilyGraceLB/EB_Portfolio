                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>I worked at Imminent XR as an intern in VP and VR developing my skills as a graphic/UX designer and learning Unity and Unreal Engine for virtual production and interactive games design. I contributed to various projects that explore a combination of VR, Virtual production and musical theatre. 
                </p>
                <h3>Project Details</h3>
                <p>I created a 3D environment in Unreal Engine 5.2 for virtual production. The environment featured a blender model of the Reichenbach Falls and was used to tell the story of Mr. Sherlock Holmes’ death from Mrs. Sherlock Holmes’ perspective. Footage recorded in the virtual production studio was then chromakeyed and placed in the Unreal project as a 2D plane.
                </p>
                <h3>Technical Skills</h3>
                <p>3D modelling with Blender
                    Using games engines, Unreal Engine 5.2
                    Creating 2D assets, Adobe Photoshop
                </p>
                <h3>Developing the project</h3>
                <h4>Creating the first 3D models</h4>
                <img src="MHDPHD_Contents/Screenshot 2024-09-05 150005.png">
                <p>I started by creating the 3D models in Blender. I created a ‘rocky wall’ model for the surrounding environment and then also created a ‘cliff edge’.
                </p>
                <h4>Assembling the 3D models in Unreal</h4>
                <img src="MHDPHD_Contents/Screenshot 2024-09-07 144241.png">
                <p>I reshaped the boulder models in Unreal to create a shape for the cliff face that spreads outwards over the falls. This platform would then be used for the 2D video plane of Mr. Sherlock Holmes. 
                </p>
                <h4>Adding the waterfall</h4>
                <img src="MHDPHD_Contents/Screenshot 2024-09-07 191342.png">
                <p>I used the cascade particle effect to create one waterfall and then layered the waterfall object at different parts of the rock wall model. This helped make better use of the space available in the environment and allowed me to add different directions for the water to follow.
                </p>
                <h3>Live performance with virtual production</h3>

                <h4>Adding additional features</h4>
                <img src="MHDPHD_Contents/Screenshot 2024-11-26 193234.png">
                <p>I added the chromakeyed green screen studio footage of Mrs. Sherlock Holmes on a 2D flat plane
                    I added ambient lighting features 
                    I added place holder objects of the battle to help judge the viewer perspective, the size of the 2D plane and its distance from the battle scene
                    I added a virtual camera to compare the position of objects in the world space from the viewers perspective
                    I added fog to simulate mist 
                </p>

                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>As part of my work experience, I was tasked with creating  pitch deck that would be sent to Meta as part of an application for the Meta Quest 3 Accelerator Programme. This pitch drew from previous work and research conducted by the team led by Mary Steward David and discussed a concept for a potential MR application that allows users to explore art in a unique way, enhanced by the capabilities of modern digital technologies.
                </p>
                <h3>Project Details</h3>
                <p>I gathered and combined footage from different research projects and previous work. This was combined into a short video edited on Adobe Premiere Pro.
