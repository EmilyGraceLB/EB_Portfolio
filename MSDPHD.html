                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>I worked at Imminent XR as an intern in VP and VR developing my skills as a graphic/UX designer and learning Unity and Unreal Engine for virtual production and interactive games design. I contributed to various projects that explore a combination of VR, Virtual production and musical theatre. 
                </p>
                <h3>Project Details</h3>
                <p>I created a 3D environment in Unreal Engine 5.2 for virtual production. The environment featured a blender model of the Reichenbach Falls and was used to tell the story of Mr. Sherlock Holmes’ death from Mrs. Sherlock Holmes’ perspective. Footage recorded in the virtual production studio was then chromakeyed and placed in the Unreal project as a 2D plane.

                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>As part of my work experience, I was tasked with creating  pitch deck that would be sent to Meta as part of an application for the Meta Quest 3 Accelerator Programme. This pitch drew from previous work and research conducted by the team led by Mary Steward David and discussed a concept for a potential MR application that allows users to explore art in a unique way, enhanced by the capabilities of modern digital technologies.
                </p>
                <h3>Project Details</h3>
                <p>I gathered and combined footage from different research projects and previous work. This was combined into a short video edited on Adobe Premiere Pro.
