                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>I worked at Imminent XR as an intern in VP and VR developing my skills as a graphic/UX designer and learning Unity and Unreal Engine for virtual production and interactive games design. I contributed to various projects that explore a combination of VR, Virtual production and musical theatre. 
                </p>
                <h3>Project Details</h3>
                <p>I created a 3D environment in Unreal Engine 5.2 for virtual production. The environment featured a blender model of the Reichenbach Falls and was used to tell the story of Mr. Sherlock Holmes’ death from Mrs. Sherlock Holmes’ perspective. Footage recorded in the virtual production studio was then chromakeyed and placed in the Unreal project as a 2D plane.
