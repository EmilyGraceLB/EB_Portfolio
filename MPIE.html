        <h1>Media Production for Interactive Environments</h1>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>For this module, I learnt to create different interactive experiences that take place within varied 3D environments using the games engine, Unity. Combining these new skills with my previous experience in 3D modelling and programming, I was able to create unique and fun interactive environments. 
        </p>
        <h3>Project Details</h3>
        <p>For this module, I was tasked with creating a 5-minute experience within a 3D environment. I decided to create a walk-through style story game, in which the player was tasked with collecting different items by following a trail of NPC characters.
